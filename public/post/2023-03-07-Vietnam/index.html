Here&rsquo;s what we got up to.</p><a data-clipboard-text=https://martsmusings.uk/post/2023-03-07-Vietnam/#the-road-to-vietnam class=header-link aria-label="Anchor The road to Vietnam" href=#the-road-to-vietnam><h1 id=the-road-to-vietnam>The road to Vietnam</h1></a><p>Our route out of Laos was a reflection of the entrance: a stint on a longboat followed by a border crossing by bus.</p><a data-clipboard-text=https://martsmusings.uk/post/2023-03-07-Vietnam/#slow-boat-to-muang-khua class=header-link aria-label="Anchor Slow boat to Muang Khua" href=#slow-boat-to-muang-khua><h2 id=slow-boat-to-muang-khua>Slow boat to Muang Khua</h2></a><p>Our departure from Nong Khiaw was unexpectedly haphazard. Having scouted a few days before, we arrived at the pier to buy a ticket for the slow boat to Muang Khua.</p><p>We got the tickets with a couple of minutes so spare, so Laura tasked me with grabbing a couple of croissants and some snacks whilst she took the bags to the boat.</p><p>My beady eye caught sight of some baguettes. As I was unsure whether there would be any lunch stops, I decided that not all heroes wear capes and also ordered a couple of cheese baguettes - with an added instruction that we need it fast as our boat leaves in 10 minutes.</p><p>I&rsquo;d hoped for some cheese slices to be crudely thrust into a baguette, with a slap of butter if he felt he had time. Standards wouldn&rsquo;t let such a monstrosity leave his kitchen however.</p><p>When he started melting the cheese with a hairdryer I kindly reminded him that we were in a bit of a rush. He then shouted through the window and softly reassured &ldquo;don&rsquo;t worry, the boat will wait for you&rdquo;.</p><p>Sandwich preparation has never caused so much anxiety. Minutes after the boat&rsquo;s scheduled departure I was dwelling on how long a captain would delay his day for the sake of somebody else&rsquo;s sandwich.</p><p>Eyes pierced as I entered the boat, meekly whispering apologies and scurrying towards raised-eyebrow Laura. They were cracking baguettes though.</p><p><em><strong>Sidenote</strong>: It then turned out that I needn&rsquo;t have worried, as the boat then round robbin&rsquo;ed between the sides of the river for 40 minutes looking for a mislaid Dutch guy. Transport works differently in Laos.</em></p><p>The rest of the boat journey was nice and chilled, and we had a good chat with a German couple sat in-front of us. On arrival, we found a hostel, grabbed our last Beerlaos and turned in early ahead of another long travel day.</p><div class=gallery-wrapper><div class=gallery-item><a data-fancybox=gallery-82e8cf26d46379b3d60c0c9a67dfbeee href=https://assets.martsmusings.uk/galleries/vietnam/part1/slow%20boat%20entry/IMG_20230222_122922.jpg><img src=https://assets.martsmusings.uk/thumbs/vietnam/part1/slow%20boat%20entry/IMG_20230222_122922.jpg class=gallery-item-thumb></a></div><div class=gallery-item><a data-fancybox=gallery-82e8cf26d46379b3d60c0c9a67dfbeee href=https://assets.martsmusings.uk/galleries/vietnam/part1/slow%20boat%20entry/IMG_20230222_131444.jpg><img src=https://assets.martsmusings.uk/thumbs/vietnam/part1/slow%20boat%20entry/IMG_20230222_131444.jpg class=gallery-item-thumb></a></div><div class=gallery-item><a data-fancybox=gallery-82e8cf26d46379b3d60c0c9a67dfbeee href=https://assets.martsmusings.uk/galleries/vietnam/part1/slow%20boat%20entry/IMG_20230222_113720.jpg><img src=https://assets.martsmusings.uk/thumbs/vietnam/part1/slow%20boat%20entry/IMG_20230222_113720.jpg class=gallery-item-thumb></a></div><div class=gallery-item><a data-fancybox=gallery-82e8cf26d46379b3d60c0c9a67dfbeee href=https://assets.martsmusings.uk/galleries/vietnam/part1/slow%20boat%20entry/IMG_20230222_173139.jpg><img src=https://assets.martsmusings.uk/thumbs/vietnam/part1/slow%20boat%20entry/IMG_20230222_173139.jpg class=gallery-item-thumb></a></div></div><a data-clipboard-text=https://martsmusings.uk/post/2023-03-07-Vietnam/#border-crossing class=header-link aria-label="Anchor Border Crossing" href=#border-crossing><h2 id=border-crossing>Border Crossing</h2></a><p>We were entering Vietnam via. a public bus from Muang Khua to Dien Bien Phu. Typical of travel in Laos, key information was scant and contradictory.</p><p>We took a punt on what we thought the ticket would cost, as we heard that the Laotian currency (Kip) is effectively worthless outside of Laos and can&rsquo;t be exchanged. We drastically underestimated, but luckily for us a fellow traveller had a wad of Kip and was happy to be our bureau de change.</p><p>We were conservative about our arrival time at the bus-stop however, and it lead to poor Laura having to deal with a lot of unwanted attention.</p><div class=gallery-wrapper><div class=gallery-item><a data-fancybox=gallery-f2ab248102a5dc1f71da492c072371e3 href=https://assets.martsmusings.uk/galleries/vietnam/part1/laura%20pap/IMG_20230223_065337.jpg><img src=https://assets.martsmusings.uk/thumbs/vietnam/part1/laura%20pap/IMG_20230223_065337.jpg class=gallery-item-thumb></a></div></div><p>Whilst waiting for the bus, a group of people dismounted their motorbikes and began paparazzing Laura. They were obsessed with how pale she was (particularly her ankles), kept grabbing her for photos and asking when we were getting married.</p><p>It started as mildly amusing, got a bit odd, then annoying. Luckily the bus arrived shortly after, so we dived on to hide. It made us realise that:</p><ul><li>In rural areas it is going to be common for people to get obsessed with our pastiness<ul><li>It does suck when personal space is invaded, but there&rsquo;s no right to it</li><li>We&rsquo;re very privileged to be travelling, many in those areas don&rsquo;t have the opportunity to do so - and are relatively rarely presented with blanched beings</li></ul></li><li>At least I no longer have a beard.

A three man team then crammed a &rsquo;neep into every nook, and a carrot into every cranny of the minibus.</p><p>What started as surreal and amusing then led us to get a bit concerned about the vehicle&rsquo;s aerodynamic situation.

It&rsquo;s in the Northern hills of Vietnam, next to the highest peak in the country (Fansipan) and a few villages that farm some stunning paddy fields.</p><p>Sapa did not appear as we expected, with neon signs and lots of hustle/bustle.

A chunk of income comes from facilitating visits from tourists.</p><p>We booked onto a tour, and were met by our guide one morning outside our hotel. After a short walk through Sapa town, we picked up another tourist and descended into the fields that led to the villages.</p><p>It began to get very muddy and a bit slippery down the hills. It didn&rsquo;t present much of an issue for myself nor Laura - being used to English weather and donning some decent hiking books. Our fellow tourist, Aussie Daniel, was in a right bind however. Equipped only with light trainers he was liable to skid all 10 kilometers.</p><div class=gallery-wrapper><div class=gallery-item><a data-fancybox=gallery-1a02a36828407251fcdb46d02ad5b452 href=https://assets.martsmusings.uk/galleries/vietnam/part1/mud1/IMG_20230225_100107.jpg><img src=https://assets.martsmusings.uk/thumbs/vietnam/part1/mud1/IMG_20230225_100107.jpg class=gallery-item-thumb></a></div></div><p>At this point a gang of villagers swooped in, and began to assist. We were aware from research that this is a &ldquo;thing&rdquo;: villagers will guide you through the mud, and at the end you have to do some shopping with them (buy some of their fabric goods).</p><p>It was a tricky one to fathom for me. Myself nor Laura didn&rsquo;t need any help in addition to the guide we&rsquo;d already paid (quite a fair whack!) for, and I personally felt that for us they provided more obstacles than assistance and didn&rsquo;t always head for the simplest paths through the mud.</p><p>It&rsquo;s how they get by though, and whilst we didn&rsquo;t need the help, Daniel most certainly did.
