Rejuvenated from a stay with Leo, we set off for our first and only stop in Central America.

Our plan was to do a short stop in Belize, primarily to see some manatees, before snaking our way down South America.

# Caye Caulker

After landing in Belize City, we immediately set sail for Caye Caulker. It's an island accessible with a short ferry crossing. It's a tourist magnet. It boasts lots of tours, many of which include the possibility of snorkeling with manatees. We booked onto one.

# Manatee Tour

First up, some fun facts about manatees:

* They're mammals, and feed their young from nipples in their armpits 🙋‍♀️🥛
* They're also known as Sea Cows 🐮
* They can live to be between 40-60 years old

We were out of luck on the first manatee stop. No sighting. We carried on, and saw some other cool marine life.

The guide promised we'd do another stop to look for manatees before heading home. We swam back out with high hopes, and we got very lucky:

The water was very cloudy. It made for a brilliant moment on approach, where the figure of the manatee gradually revealed itself. We got to spend a few minutes with him before he swam further into the ocean.

Our main goal in Belize was ticked off ✅.

# Cooling Off 🥵

The island was like a furnace. We were extremely thankful of the air conditioning in our hostel, so spent a lot of time chilling out there. We found some good places to eat/drink for the rest of our time:

# Pelicans and Sea Horses

A beach bar seemed to attract lots of Pelicans, Stingrays and Sea Horses. (We presume they fed them, which isn't good for them 🙁). We managed to get a couple of snaps and hang around with the pelicans for a bit:

But it was so hot that we could barely function. We quickly ran  away to a more shaded part of the island.

# Onwards

That brings us to the end of our short stay in Belize. We were incredibly lucky to be able to snorkel with a manatee 😁 and enjoyed seeing the other wildlife.

Next up, we flew to Colombia. Not sure our parents were big fans of this destination. But we had a great time, and it felt very safe. Join us next time!
