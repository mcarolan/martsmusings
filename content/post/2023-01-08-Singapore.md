Singapore wasn't originally on our itinerary, and we mostly ended up going as it was the cheapest route into Southeast Asia when we booked. We had a great few days there and left feeling like it was the perfect entry point to gently ease us in.
All signs were in English, it's super safe (a friend we met up with said we could abandon our phone on a table whilst going to the toilet and it'd still be there when we got back - and I believe it), and it's so easy to get around.

# Accomodation

Accommodation is notoriously expensive, so to avoid emptying our bank account in the first week we opted for a mixed dorm... with a twist ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€

Space-pods! You feel like an astronaut, it slightly improves privacy in a 12-bed dorm, and the screen reduces the snoring of astronauts on other ships down to the white noise you'd expect from space travel. What more could you want?

It worked pretty well for us. Certainly won't win any cleanliness awards, and some fellow astronauts gabbing away well into the early hours wasn't ideal - but for Â£37 per night we were over the moon to not be paying astronomic prices in Singapore.

# Cleanliness and Fines

Singapore is by *far* the most clean city either of us had ever seen.

Whilst COVID-19 restrictions and entry requirements for tourists were quite liberal, mask wearing is very strongly enforced on public transport. Guards actively check when you enter the metro, and _everybody_ keeps them on at all times.

There is absolutely no food nor drink allowed on public transport, a S$500 (Â£309) fine is actively enforced.

# Greenery

Singapore is by *far* the most green city either of us had ever seen. There are highways going through - but all of them have a nice plant bed running along side. There are sky scrapers - but most have a middle and/or top floor garden that's very visible from the street. And whilst it's a super-dense manufactured urban environment - they have set aside some areas for flora and fauna to flourish.

## TreeTop walk

Accessible in just under an hour for just over a dollar, one of the highlights of our stay was a [TreeTop walk](https://www.nparks.gov.sg/gardens-parks-and-nature/parks-and-nature-reserves/central-catchment-nature-reserve/treetop-walk) by MacRitchie.
It starts off looking like a nice pleasant boardwalk stroll, and then BAM - you're basically in a jungle.

On a roughly 10k walk we got up close and personal with monkeys, wild board, water monitors (eww) and lots of cool trees and insects. A very welcome break from metropolis.

## Gardens by the Bay

Right slap-bang in the middle of the city is a complex of botanical gardens that makes The Eden Project look like the allotments in Poynton.

They've recreated mountain conditions in a giant multi-story greenhouse with a waterfall.

They generate energy and expel heat through gigantic steel super-trees, covered by wild plants. A couple of super-trees have lifts and walkways for tourists to get a good view, and they all perform an light-show at 8pm every evening.

Basically they're not messing around. If you ever get the opportunity and enjoy nature, don't hesitate to dive in as it's quite spectacular.

# East Coast Park

We're always up for working a Parkrun into the trip, and this was no exception. With Singaporean Parkruns starting at the eyewatering time of 7:30am, it was quite a mission to get there. But totally worth it, and we were ultimately glad at how early the run started given how hot and bothered we were with the humidity by the end.

It was an out and back, and flat as a pancake. The park was *really* heavily used by runners/cyclists not participating in Parkrun - probably trying  to squeeze in some miles before it gets too hot. Decent views out onto the Singapore Strait. At one point you run alongside a beach, which we later learnt was totally artificial. Due to the harbour tide (or like there of) a truck comes and dumps more sand there every now and again.
