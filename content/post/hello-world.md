## What's going on?

Well, after a slight delay due to a pandemic,  we're due to go travelling for a year. Starting this Saturday.

## Where are you going?

The high level plan is Southeast Asia, South America and then New Zealand.

Probably around 4 / 6 / 2 months respectively in each - and we're aiming for shoulder seasons. (yeah, I didn't know what that meant either - it's the happy medium of good weather conditions with dwindling tourist numbers).

##  What are you doing here?

It's an amazing opportunity and I'd quite like to write about it. If anybody is interested in where we're up to, this will hopefully be a good place to check-in. Also I'll try to share lots of cool stuff we see/do along the way to help with your own travels :muscle:
