We began our South American adventure in Colombia, and assumed our new identities.

Whenever we introduced ourselves as Martin and Laura we were met with foggy expressions üßê. A quick pronunciation tweak has worked wonders. We now refer to ourselves as Marteen and Laowra. 

We only had a short time in Colombia, 11 days. We managed to cram a lot in, and really enjoyed our time.

Let's see what happened!

# Medell√≠n

## History

Our first stop was Medell√≠n, a city with a notoriously bloody history. Its troubles are dramatised by Netflix series "Narcos", and don't paint a pretty (or fair, according to locals) picture. Full transparency, we weren't aware of any of this before. Other than some names ringing  a  bell üîî.

In the 80's and 90's Medell√≠n was widely regarded as one of the most dangerous cities in the world. It's achieved an incredible turnaround. Its homicide rate [now sits lower](https://www.medellinadvisors.com/homicide-theft-in-medellin-2022-mid-year-figures/) than many cities in Europe. We still chose to stay in the safest comuna.

Our main activity was a free walking tour of the city. It was led by an incredible guide. He grew up during some of the grimmest moments of Medell√≠n's history. He was knowledgeable, enthusiastic and, we felt, very balanced.

Medell√≠n's most troubling times were during the life of Pablo Escobar. His cartel supplied 80% of the world's cocaine. The cartel spent [$2,500 per month on rubber bands](https://www.businessinsider.com/pablo-escobar-and-rubber-bands-2015-9), needed to hold together the stacks of cash they raked  in. Escobar entered politics, and frequently [used terrorism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avianca_Flight_203) to gain influence.

Our guide refused to refer to Escobar by name. He instead referred to him as Voldemort. He said nothing good comes from saying Escobar's name in public in Medell√≠n. People overhearing are either:

* Of his age (early thirties) or elder, and remember living through this period. He vividly remembers shootings being a commonplace occurrence. His cousin was raped then murdered.
* Younger, and think that Escobar also did good. Such as building houses. Our guide is of the impression that no good outweighs the other actions. I'd agree.
* Idiots with Narcos hoodies who think Escobar is a badass.

The walking tour involved very little walking. There was a big focus on the history of the city and how it made such a transformation. It fascinating to hear. Large factors in the transformation were:

* Building the [world's first aerial tram system](https://www.wri.org/insights/urban-transformations-medellin-metrocable-connects-people-more-ways-one). This connected the slums on Medell√≠n's hillside with the city center. It reduced a journey of 2 hours with multiple fares to a single 30  minute journey. Residents are *very* proud of it, and look after it well. We tried it out -  it is superb.
* [Opening 13 libraries](https://psmag.com/social-justice/library-parks-bring-community-to-colombia-39915) in the roughest neighbourhoods. The 4 biggest included free childcare  facilities, movie theatres, and classes.  

He also argued that an attitude of transparency has helped their recovery. He showed us the most notable example of this, in San Antonio Plaza.

The city is filled with caricaturial statues by hometown artist Fernando Botero. The statues are of people and animals with bizarre proportions:

In 1995 the son of Fernando Botero was defense minister. A guerilla group filled a Botero statue on San Antonio Plaza with dynamite. They detonated it during a concert in the plaza. It killed 30 and injured more than 200 people.

Botero was defiant. An identical statue was donated on the proviso that it always stand next to the torn shell of the original. 

They're now known as [the birds of peace](https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-birds-of-peace-medellin-colombia). Our guide believed the mindset shown in the aftermath of this tragedy allowed the city to remember whilst transforming. He embraced this spirit himself, and revealed that his main line of work is music production. He just does a couple of tours as week as he believes it's important for the city.

## Nowadays

We felt incredibly safe during our time in Medell√≠n. Locals were welcoming, pleased we were visiting and mentioned many times that we should tell our friends it's safe to visit. We can do so without reservation. It also had some of the best hipstery food we've had this year. We loved hanging out there:

### Comuna 13

We also took a free walking tour in Medell√≠n's Comuna 13. It's in the hillside, and was full of slums. It was the most dangerous area of Medell√≠n. It's now completely safe. There is lots of cool graffiti:

Many streets stalls, an electric escalator to get up the hill, and, of course, a craft beer brewery:



# Guatap√©

Guatap√© is a stones throw from Medell√≠n. Our main draw for visiting was that Laura thought the village looked very pretty üòÇ. The buildings have murals of the trade the occupiers practice:

It was a great place to spend a day chilling out in.

We also climbed a weird looking rock that was close:

# Salento

Due south from Medell√≠n, Salento is a quaint town that turned out to be a real highlight. It recently served as [inspiration for Disney's  2021 film, Encanto](https://swisherpost.co.za/travel/places-to-visit-colombia-inspired-disney-encanto-photo/).

## ‚òï Coffee

It sits next to a large number of coffee plantations. Our plan for the day after arrival was to book onto a tour of them. The owner of the [restaurant we had dinner](https://goo.gl/maps/iCVevdajRYxbUBJ38) at very kindly told us to not waste our money. He said it's only a 5km ramble to visit them all. They all have coffee bars you can enter en route to keep yourself fuelled. And that the furthest away plantation gets limited footfall, is the best, and is owned an enthusiastic old dude who will give a great tour if you rock up.

We took his word and DIY'ed it. It was a brilliant ramble down. I was very fueled:

The final plantation, [El Recuerdo](https://goo.gl/maps/qMGqxwQeew64Yiiw8), was indeed owned by an enthusiastic old dude who gave a cracking tour.

He's been keen on sustainability during the decades he's been coffee farming. Other local plantations have chased mono-cultures (solely planting coffee plants), fertilizers and pesticides. He has no regrets in keeping things natural. It gives him a sought after product. Other local plantations have recently approached him to give advice in adopting more sustainable methods.

Colombia produces Arabica beans. Almost entirely for export - it's big money. The most popular type of coffee consumed domestically is Nescafe üòÇ. He walked us through the whole production process, which was fascinating.

He proudly allows a huge variety of crops to grow alongside the coffee on his land. It provides shade, nutrients and natural protection the plants would not otherwise get. He explained how he uses many crops for natural medicines, plied us with various fruits, and showed us his cocaine bush:

We ended with an espresso. It was delicious. I'm not often a fan of espresso, but think I'll definitely dabble in the future if I get my mitts on some good quality beans.

He was a member of and advocate for the Rainforest Alliance, which promotes sustainable practice and fair trade for coffee plantations. Will definitely keep an eye out for the label on coffee beans in the future.

## üå¥ Palm Trees

Cocora Valley is a short journey by jeep from Salento. I got the short straw. There wasn't room for me inside. I spent 20 hair-raising minutes clinging on to the back. I definitely got the best view, but it tested the upper body strength that I don't have.

Cocora Valley is home to some of the tallest palm trees in the world. They [rise to over 70 metres](https://wander-lush.org/cocora-valley-hike-salento-colombia/). Rumour has it that originally it was a dense forest. It's suffered from deforestation. Some of the individuals that thrived the most remain. So not a feel good story, but still very cool to gander at üå¥.

We did an 8 mile loop around the valley. I was flagging, but got second wind after we  stopped off for a Canelazo. It's an [Irished up green tea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canelazo). 

We made friends with a dude from Costa Rica along the way, and visited a hummingbird sanctuary:

I was lucky that he offered us a lift back to Salento. It was much more relaxing than a white-knuckle jeep ride üò±.

## üí• Tejo

Tejo is an [explosive and traditional](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tejo_(sport)) sport in Colombia. It's so up my street that it's a bit ridiculous. There's an angled pit of clay. A steel ring is in the center. 4 explosives are placed around the ring:

* You lob a stone at the ring from a distance.
* You score points based on the extent of explosion you cause. 
* It's traditional to drink beer whilst playing.

There were a bunch of local old dudes who were extremely jovial and clearly took great enjoyment in spending their evenings teaching gringos (tourists) the sport  of Tejo.

Here's a video of Laura hitting the jackpot:

This isn't going to be believed, but that's OK. I was actually really good, caused lots of explosion, and whooped Laura's bum. It's just we had low phone battery, and every time I was filmed it was a dud. But that's OK.

I was extremely excited to learn that a Tejo establishment was running in London. At last a viable alternative to Flight Club. Alas it has since shut permanently üôÅ.

# Tatacoa Desert

We ended our time in Colombia by visiting the Tatacoa Desert üèúÔ∏è. I got complacent in thinking that we no longer needed air conditioning since entering South America. I didn't consider that we were staying **in a desert**. We had the most humid night's "sleep" ever. No worth saving the couple of quid.

We rambled around the desert the next day:

And managed to get extremely lost within 10 minutes. It's like a rabbit warren. Such a strange sensation. We felt safe as we could *see* the way out of the labyrinth. But also it was extremely humid, we were running out of water, and walking around in circles. It was hard not to have a completely unnecessary mild panic.

We made it out unscathed.

# Conclusion

All that was within 11 days in Colombia! We absolutely loved it, and wish our schedule allowed more time. It's definitely a country we'll be looking to visit again. Hope you enjoyed reading about it. Next up we head to Ecuador, where we visited the equator and hiked up/down a crater ü•æ.
